# Taxi-Management-Application
Taxi Management Application is a simple and efficient taxi management system designed to help taxi companies organize their vehicles, assign drivers, track shifts, and generate reports. Built with C# and MySQL, this application streamlines taxi management and ensures smooth daily operations.

Employee Management – Register drivers with personal details like name, age, and tax number (AFM).

Shift Tracking – Assign shift start and end times to drivers.

Vehicle Service Management - Register services for vehicles registered by the employees.

Print Reports – Generate and print shift reports directly from the application.

Data Validation – Ensures required fields are properly filled before database entry.


Technologies Used:

C# language – For the user interface and application logic.

MySQL – For database storage and management.
